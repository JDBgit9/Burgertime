# Burgertime

## Description
In this asignment I created a burger logger with MYSQL, node, Express, Handlebars and ORM.   I used Node amd My SQL to query and route data in the app. I changed it up a little bit with a drop down menu. The user will go to the app and choees from a list of burgers and then the will click on the thumbs up icon and the choice will be displayed on the order panel with a money sign button next to it. once the user clicks the money sign button the order will thne move over to the devour panel. The red trash button next to it is clicked and the burger is now devoured. I had to use heroku to remotely connect to it's database.
